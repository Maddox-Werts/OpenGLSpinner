# OpenGLSpinner

## Why? ##
Getting back into OpenGL so I just decided to make a simple spinning cube program with OpenGL, GLEW, GLM, and GLFW.

## What do I need? ##
This ONLY works on windows ( Works as is ) & linux ( Scroll down for info )
To compile this yourself you'll need Visual Studio, and Visual C++.
I already have it set up to where it'll automatically detect where your
* Include
* Lib
folders are.

## Linux? ##
I recommend VSCode. But you'll need to do the following:
* Change the directory setup
* Create a Makefile
* Find compatible libraries ( Since this project uses Visual C++, which is Windows ONLY )

# IMPORTANT NOTICE #
If you're compiling on Linux, I don't know if GLEW has pre-built binaries.
